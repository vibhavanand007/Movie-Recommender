## Movie Recommendation end-to-end project with live link

live-link >> https://moviesrecommender0.streamlit.app/ (using Streamlit)


I developed a movie recommendation system that suggests movies based on user-selected films by training a model to analyze similarities and preferences.
Using Streamlit, I created an interactive web interface that allows users to input their movie choices and receive personalized recommendations. The project was successfully deployed on the Streamlit server, offering a smooth and user-friendly experience.
